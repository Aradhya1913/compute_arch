🧠 #compute_arch – 30-Hour Roadmap to Master Core Computer Understanding

This curated 30-hour plan is designed for final-year engineering students, freshers, or anyone feeling weak in core computer fundamentals like hardware, operating systems, Linux, and basic networking.

🔍 What you’ll learn if you follow this roadmap:
	•	How a computer physically works — from CPU, RAM to BIOS and boot-up
	•	Mastery over OS concepts like processes, memory, filesystems, and system calls
	•	Practical Linux usage and terminal confidence (not just GUI-level usage)
	•	Clear mental models of how networking works — IPs, ports, DNS, firewalls
	•	Real system-level commands, shell scripting, and hands-on labs in VirtualBox

🎯 Why this guide?
If you’ve ever said “I can code, but I don’t understand how the system underneath works” — this is for you. It’s not just theory. It’s a learn-by-doing journey, powered by carefully picked videos, tools, and tasks.

📚 Built with care. Verified with precision. All links work. Every step matters.
